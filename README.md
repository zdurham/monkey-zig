# Monkey Language Zig Implementation

This is an implementation of the interpreter from [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) in zig. This is both an attempt to learn more about interpreters while also trying out a low level systems language. While the book doesn't include explicit steps to, I intend to also build a garbage collector to go along with the interpreter.
